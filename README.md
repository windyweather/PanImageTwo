# PanImageTwo
This is a JavaFx test program to explore displaying images with 
Pan and Zoom in a ScrollPanel. 

This second iteration uses the fxml gui from PanImageTest and the code from
ImagePanZoom to try to make a working program. ImagePanZoom works, but does
not use fxml and so cannot be the basis of a more complex program.

Here's hoping after struggling for a couple of weeks with PanImageTest.
